Twilio / Zendesk Integration Example

Background
---------

Zendesk is a Helpdesk system for receiving and responding to trouble tickets,
support requests, etc. Each customer service people can jump into particlar
tickets/threads as they need. All exchanges are via email.

In this scenario, I plug into Twilio to allow SMS to replace email completely
and transparency. The flow is as follows:

*  A customer sends an SMS to a short/long code requesting support;
*  This script receives the incoming SMS and checks for an open ticket from
this phone number:
**  If there is not a match, a new ticket is created using the body of the SMS
and attaching the phone number as an attribute;
**  If there is a match, the SMS is appended to the existing ticket;
*  When a customer service representative responds to the ticket, an SMS is
sent back out through Twilio to the original requestor.
